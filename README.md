# Maze
This project is one of data structure project about helping an explorer claim the orb in an unknown cavern with time limits. 
After picking up the orb, the new layout of cavern is generated. There're full of amounts of golds at different tiles while 
each tile costs weighted steps. The explorer has to get out of the cavern before it collapses (step limits) and the golds are bonus.
